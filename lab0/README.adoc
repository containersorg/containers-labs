== 3. Create a New Virtual Machine

Here's a guide to creating a virtual machine (VM) with at least 3 GB of RAM, 1 CPU, and a 40 GB hard drive using the virtualization engines discussed earlier for Windows and macOS.

=== VirtualBox

. Open VirtualBox and click on the "New" button.
. Name: Enter a name for your VM 
. Type: Linux
. Version: Fedora (64-bit)
. Memory Size: Set the memory (RAM) to a minimum of 3072 MB (3 GB).
. Choose "Create a virtual hard disk now" and click "Create."
. Select "VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)" and click "Next."
. Choose "Fixed size" to improve performance.
. Set the hard disk size to 40 GB and click "Create."
. CPU Configuration:
.. Click on "Settings" > "System" > "Processor."
.. Allocate at least 1 CPU core.
. Attach an ISO File:
.. Under "Storage," click on the empty disk icon and then the disk icon next to "Optical Drive."
.. Choose the ISO file of the operating system you want to install.
. Click "Start" to boot the VM and begin the OS installation.

=== VMware Workstation Player

. Open VMware Workstation Player and click "Create a New Virtual Machine."
. Installer Disk Image File: Choose "Installer disc image file (iso)" and browse to the location of your OS ISO file.
. Virtual Machine Name: Enter a name for your VM and choose a location to store it.
Disk Capacity: Set the disk size to 40 GB and select "Store virtual disk as a single file."
. Customize Hardware:
.. Click on "Customize Hardware."
.. Set the memory to a minimum of 3072 MB (3 GB).
.. Set the number of processors to at least 1.
. Click "Close" and then "Finish."
. Start the VM: Click "Play virtual machine" to install the OS.

=== Hyper-V

. Open Hyper-V Manager and click on "New" > "Virtual Machine."

. Click "Finish" and then "Start" to boot the VM.

=== Parallels Desktop

. Open Parallels Desktop and click "File" > "New."
. Choose Installation Method: Select "Install Windows or another OS from a DVD or image file" and select the OS image.
. Set Up VM Configuration:
.. Set the RAM to a minimum of 3072 MB (3 GB).
.. Set the number of CPU cores to at least 1.
.. Set the hard disk size to 40 GB.
. Name your VM and choose a location.
. Click "Create" and then "Start" to launch the VM.

=== UTM (Using QEMU Backend)

. Open UTM and click on "Create a New Virtual Machine."
. Choose the OS you want to install.
. Set the memory to a minimum of 3072 MB (3 GB).
. Set the number of CPU cores to at least 1.
. Create a new virtual hard disk with 40 GB of space.
. Attach the ISO file of the OS.
. Click "Create" and then "Start" to boot the VM.

== 4. Install Fedora Server on the VM

. Start the VM, and it will boot from the Fedora Server ISO.
. Select your language and keyboard layout.
. Set the installation destination to the virtual hard disk you created.
. Configure the network if needed.
. Set a root password and create a user account.
. After installation, reboot the VM and remove the installation media.

== 5. Update Fedora Server

. Log in to your VM.
. Run the following commands to update the system:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf upgrade -y
sudo systemctl reboot
----

== 6. Install Podman

. Log in to your VM
. Install Podman using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf install -y podman
----

Verify the installation by checking the Podman version:

[source,shell]
----
podman --version
----

== 7. Configure the Environment for Podman

Enable user namespaces if necessary:

[source,shell]
----
sudo sysctl -w user.max_user_namespaces=15000
----

Ensure that your user is part of the wheel group (for root privileges):

[source,shell]
----
sudo usermod -aG wheel your_username
----

== 8. Test Podman with a Simple Container

Run a basic container to ensure Podman is working correctly:

[source,shell]
----
podman run --rm -it fedora bash
----

This command will pull the Fedora container image, run it interactively, and drop you into a bash shell.

== 9. Optional: Install Cockpit for Web Management

Cockpit provides a web interface to manage your server and containers.

Install and enable Cockpit with:

[source,shell]
----
sudo dnf install -y cockpit cockpit-*
sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
----

Open the firewall for Cockpit:

[source,shell]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

Access Cockpit through your browser at https://<your_VM_IP>:9090.
