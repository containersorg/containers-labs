= containers-labs: From Monolith to Kubernetes

This repository contains the example project designed as laboratory exercises for the 'Containers and Microservices' course at Collin College.

The repository is structured to take you through a comprehensive, step-by-step journey: from modeling traditional monolithic applications to deploying a modern, resilient, multi-service application stack on a Kubernetes cluster.

== 1. Lab Index (The Containerization Journey)

The entire course progression is managed through separate Git branches. To begin a lab, check out the corresponding branch (e.g., `git checkout lab-01`).

== 2. Final Conclusion: The Value of Containerization

The series of labs demonstrates the fundamental shift required for modern application management, moving from brittle, tightly-coupled code to secure, scalable microservices.

====
**Key Operational & Security Lessons Learned**

. **Immutability:** Images are single sources of truth. Changes are never applied to running containers; instead, a new, clean image version is built and deployed.
. **Persistence vs. Immutability:** Data must be externalized from the container's volatile filesystem and placed into a dedicated **Volume** to survive crashes and restarts.
. **Security:** Secrets are never stored in source code or environment variables.
. **Isolation:** Moving from the insecure Host Network to a dedicated **Bridge Network** is crucial for preventing container conflicts.
. **Orchestration:** Tools like **Compose** and **Kubernetes** are necessary to manage the lifecycle, networking, and scaling of multiple interconnected services automatically.
