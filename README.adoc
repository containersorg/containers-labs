= Lab4 - Creating Images Using Running Containers
tip-caption: 💡 TIP
:warning-caption: ⚠️ WARNING

Our microservices are currently running inside containers from Lab 3. However, if we stop one of them, we lose all the manual changes we made (installing Python, Flask, copying code) because those changes only exist on the container's **writable layer**.

[NOTE]
====
Run the following commands to restart the containers if they were stopped after Lab 3.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman start inventory_service order_service customer_service billing_service
----
====

To retain their current state permanently and create a reusable artifact, we must **commit** the changes to a new image.

== 1. Committing Containers to New Images

The `podman commit` command creates a new image by flattening the container's current state (including the writable layer where we installed dependencies and copied files) into a new, read-only image layer.

=== Commit Running Containers

Run the following commands to create permanent images from the running containers. We tag them with `:manual` to signify their origin.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman commit inventory_service inventory_image:manual
$ podman commit order_service order_image:manual
$ podman commit customer_service customer_image:manual
$ podman commit billing_service billing_image:manual
----

=== Verify the New Images

We now have four new images based on the Fedora base layer, but with all application prerequisites baked in:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman image ls | grep 'manual'
localhost/billing_image                       manual      e4d7b04b037e  49 seconds ago  367 MB
localhost/customer_image                      manual      3c23cf252db4  2 minutes ago   367 MB
localhost/order_image                         manual      0c92de394820  10 minutes ago  367 MB
localhost/inventory_image                     manual      2b092be67e62  10 minutes ago  367 MB
----

== 2. Running Services from the Custom Images

=== Stop and Verify Cleanup

Stop all currently running containers (if any are left from previous lab) and remove them from the active list.

[source,shell]
----
# Stop all running containers
$ podman stop -a
$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE      COMMAND    CREATED    STATUS    PORTS      NAMES
# Output should be empty

# Remove all containers
$ podman rm -a
$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE      COMMAND    CREATED    STATUS    PORTS      NAMES
# Output should be empty
----

=== Launch Services Using the New Images

We no longer need to execute `/bin/bash`. Instead, we specify the application's command (`python3 service.py`) directly, as the dependencies are guaranteed to exist within the image itself.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman run --name inventory_service --network host -d localhost/inventory_image:manual python3 inventory_service.py
$ podman run --name order_service --network host -d localhost/order_image:manual python3 order_service.py
$ podman run --name customer_service --network host -d localhost/customer_image:manual python3 customer_service.py
$ podman run --name billing_service --network host -d localhost/billing_image:manual python3 billing_service.py
----

NOTE: When running the containers, we must explicitly state the application command (`python3 service.py`) because we haven't yet defined a formal **ENTRYPOINT** or **CMD** in a `Containerfile`.

== 3. Testing the Immutable Images

The application should function identically to the end of Lab 2/Fix, but the setup process has been significantly simplified.

=== Verify Connectivity

Use a free terminal to verify the Inventory Service (Port 5001) is running:

[source,shell]
----
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/view_inventory
{"inventory":{...}} 
----

=== Cross-Service Validation (Order Placement)

Verify that the Order Service (Port 5002) can still communicate with the Inventory Service (Port 5001) to check stock.

[source,shell]
----
# Attempt to place a valid order
$ curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"customer_id": "customer_id_1", "medicine": "medicine_A", "quantity": 5}' \
    http://localhost:5002/place_order

# Verify the order exists on port 5002
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5002/view_orders
----

== 4. Conclusion

We have successfully transitioned to running our microservices from **immutable images**. This means that if you destroy and restart the containers, the application prerequisites and code are instantly available, demonstrating the core principle of repeatable deployment.

== 5. Terminating the Lab

WARNING: Terminate the services before moving to the next lab.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman stop -a
