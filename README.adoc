= Lab 10 - Troubleshooting the Application
:tip-caption: 💡 TIP
:warning-caption: ⚠️ WARNING

In a containerized environment, effective troubleshooting relies on system tools, performance monitoring, and self-healing configurations.

== 1. Debugging and Logging

Linux containers stream their application logs (STDOUT/STDERR) directly to the host's logging system (`journald`). We can use specialized tools to view this stream.

Start by installing the powerful **LNAV (LogFile Navigator)** tool, which automatically aggregates and displays logs in a readable format.

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo dnf install -y lnav
----

Run the containers from Lab 9 if they are not already running.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman start inventory_service order_service billing_service customer_service
----

=== View Container Logs

Use `journalctl` to filter logs for a specific container and pipe the output to `lnav`. This allows you to quickly view and search the application output, including errors and access logs.

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=order_service | lnav
----

NOTE: The `CONTAINER_NAME` filter relies on the journald logging driver automatically setting this metadata during container execution.

A few useful `lnav` commands:

- Press `q` to quit `lnav`.
- Press `/` to start a search.
- Press `:` to see available commands.
- Press `n` to go to the next search result.
- Press `F` to follow the log output in real-time (like `tail -f`).

== 2. Monitoring Performance

We use built-in Podman commands to monitor the health and performance statistics of our running microservices.

=== Check Running Processes

The `podman top` command shows the processes running *inside* a specific container, similar to running `ps aux` in Linux.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman top order_service
----

=== Monitor Live Statistics

The `podman stats` command provides an aggregate, live view of CPU, memory, and I/O usage for all running containers.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman stats
----

Use `CTRL+C` to exit the live view.

== 3. Enabling Self-Healing (Health Checks)

To ensure orchestration systems (like Kubernetes, or simply a restart script) know when a service is truly available, we define a **Health Check**. This is a simple command run periodically by the container runtime.

=== Define the Health Check

We will add a health check to the `inventory_service` container. The health check command uses `curl` to hit the `/view_inventory` endpoint, which must return an HTTP 200 status. If it fails, the process exits (status 1), marking the container as *unhealthy*.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman rm -f inventory_service
$ podman run --name inventory_service --network pharmacy -p 5001:5001 \
    --health-cmd='curl http://0.0.0.0:5001/view_inventory || exit 1' \
    --health-interval=10s -d localhost/pharmacy:v5 inventory_service.py
----

=== Inspect Health Status

After running the container, inspect its status with `podman ps` to see the results of the periodic health check.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman ps
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED   STATUS             NAMES
c8d...        localhost/pharmacy:v5 inventory_service.py 15s ago  Up 14s (healthy)   inventory_service
----

Notice the status column now includes **`(healthy)`**.

You can also manually trigger a check and retrieve the status programmatically:

[source,shell]
----
$ podman healthcheck run inventory_service
# No Output confirms the check was executed.

$ podman inspect --format='{{json .State.Health.Status}}' inventory_service
"healthy"
----

Let's explore a few other health options while simulating a failure by using the wrong port in the health check command. This will cause the health check to fail, marking the container as *unhealthy*.

[source,shell]
----
$ podman rm -f inventory_service
$ podman run --name inventory_service --network pharmacy -p 5001:5001 \
    --health-cmd='curl http://0.0.0.0:5555/view_inventory || exit 1' \
    --health-interval=10s \
    --health-retries=1 \
    --health-start-period=5s \
    --health-timeout=2s \
    --health-on-failure=restart \
     -d localhost/pharmacy:v5 inventory_service.py
----

Watch the progression of the health status every 3 seconds using the `watch` command:

[source,shell]
----
$ watch -wctn 3 "podman inspect inventory_service | grep -w Health -A1"
----

This feature gives you an immediate, reliable, at-a-glance view of your application's operational state, moving you toward truly self-healing, automated deployments. 

== 4. Terminating the Lab

[source,shell]
----
$ podman stop -a
----
